RPi on an RC car hosts wifi and runs HTTP server. Smartphone connects to
wifi and loads a web app which uses websockets or AJAX to send data from
accelerometer and inputs in web app to car which then turns and changes
speed

Video stream from camera attached to car is displayed in web app and
"driver" can controll the car even without direct visual contact.
